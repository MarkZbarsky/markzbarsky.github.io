                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>I assembled a Pixie QRP (low-power) radio transceiver kit as part of a soldering workshop. This compact radio operates in the 7 MHz amateur radio band and can be used for both receiving and transmitting Morse code signals. The project provided an excellent opportunity to improve my soldering skills while learning about radio frequency circuits and the principles of radio communication.</p>

                    <h2>The Build Process</h2>
                    <p>The Pixie radio kit came with all the necessary components including resistors, capacitors, transistors, crystal oscillator, and a printed circuit board. The assembly process involved carefully identifying each component and soldering them to the board in the correct orientation.</p>
                    
                    <p>Having limited prior soldering experience, this project presented a valuable learning opportunity. I learned proper soldering techniques such as:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Preparing the soldering iron and workspace</li>
                        <li>Proper temperature control for different components</li>
                        <li>Creating clean, solid solder joints</li>
                        <li>Avoiding common issues like cold joints or solder bridges</li>
                        <li>Working with temperature-sensitive components</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <h2>Learning About Radio Technology</h2>
                    <p>Beyond the hands-on assembly, this project provided insight into the physics and engineering behind radio communication. I learned about:</p>

                            <h3>Radio Frequency Principles</h3>
                            <p>The Pixie operates in the 7 MHz band (40 meters), using a crystal oscillator to generate the carrier frequency. I gained an understanding of how electromagnetic waves propagate through space and how frequency relates to wavelength through the equation λ = c/f, where c is the speed of light.</p>

                            <h3>Circuit Components</h3>
                            <p>Each component in the radio serves a specific purpose. The crystal oscillator generates a stable frequency, transistors amplify the signal, capacitors filter unwanted frequencies, and resistors control current flow. This practical application reinforced theoretical concepts from my coursework.</p>

                            <p>The Pixie design is reminiscent of early radio technology, offering a glimpse into the evolution of communication systems. From Marconi's first transatlantic transmission to modern digital communication, radio technology has a rich history of innovation that continues to influence today's wireless systems.</p>

                            <p>Some of the smaller components had color-coded markings that were difficult to interpret.</p>
                            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> I created a reference sheet with component values and used a multimeter to verify resistor values before soldering.</p>

                            <p>The PCB had closely spaced pads that required careful soldering to avoid bridges.</p>
                            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> I used a finer soldering tip and practiced on spare components before working on the actual board.</p>

                            <p><strong>Solution:</strong> I methodically checked each connection with a continuity tester, identified a cold solder joint, and repaired it to restore functionality.</p>

                    <h2>Reflections</h2>
                    <p>This project was particularly valuable as it combined practical electronics skills with theoretical knowledge. The satisfaction of building a functional communication device from individual components gave me a deeper appreciation for electronic systems.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Pixie radio kit, despite its simplicity, demonstrates fundamental principles that apply to more complex systems. This hands-on experience reinforced my interest in hardware development and provided practical context for concepts covered in my engineering coursework.</p>
