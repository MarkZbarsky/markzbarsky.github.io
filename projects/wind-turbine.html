                    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                    <p>As part of my research with Polymathic Innovations, I engineered a data collection system for a prototype Savonius vertical-axis wind turbine (VAWT). I developed custom software using C++ and Python to interface with various sensors installed throughout the turbine structure. This system continuously monitored performance metrics and published data to Excel spreadsheets for detailed analysis. Through iterative optimization based on the collected data, our team successfully improved the turbine's efficiency by 15%. This project demonstrated the practical application of sustainable energy solutions specifically designed for urban environments, where traditional horizontal-axis turbines are less practical.</p>

                            <p>The project began with evaluating the existing turbine prototype and identifying key performance metrics that needed monitoring. We determined that RPM, torque, wind speed, and power output were the critical parameters to track.</p>

                            <p>I researched and selected appropriate sensors for each metric, including hall effect sensors for RPM measurement, strain gauges for torque, and anemometers for wind speed. Each sensor required custom mounting solutions to ensure accurate readings without affecting turbine performance.</p>

                            <p>I designed a microcontroller-based data acquisition system using an Arduino Mega as the central hub. This system collected data from all sensors at configurable intervals and transmitted it to a Raspberry Pi for processing and storage.</p>
